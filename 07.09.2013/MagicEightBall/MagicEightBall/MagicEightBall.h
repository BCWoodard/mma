/*
 You  need to ask your Magic Eight Ball app a few questions… Why am I here? Will I find the person of my dreams? Am I ever going to understand how to be a developer? What is the answer to life the universe and everything?
 
 In the MagicEightBall project, you will find a ViewController class. The interface elements have already been hooked up such that you will only need to implement the “magic.”
 
 1. Create a MagicEightBall class
 2. Add a method on that class that returns a random string
 3. Import the MagicEightBall class into ViewController.m class file (hint: import the header file)
 4. Call your method to return your random string.
 5. Assign that string to answerLabel.text
